# ChallengeProject
This C# console application is designed to:
- Use arrays to store student names and assignment scores.
- Use a `foreach` statement to iterate through the student names as an outer program loop.
- Use an `if` statement within the outer loop to identify the current student name and access that student's assignment scores.
- Use a `foreach` statement within the outer loop to iterate though the assignment scores array and sum the values.
- Use an algorithm within the outer loop to calculate the average exam score for each student.
- Use an `if-elseif-else` construct within the outer loop to evaluate the average exam score and assign a letter grade automatically.
- Integrate extra credit scores when calculating the student's final score and letter grade as follows:
    - detects extra credit assignments based on the number of elements in the student's scores array.
    - divides the values of extra credit assignments by 10 before adding extra credit scores to the sum of exam scores.
- use the following report format to report student grades: 

Student         Exam Score      Overall Grade   Extra Credit
